= Deploy Concourse
Now that you have a secondary BOSH environment running, its time to use it for something useful. This module will help you deploy a Bosh Managed Concourse cluster to AWS.

Please read official Concourse documentation for link:https://concourse.ci/clusters-with-bosh.html[Deploying a Bosh Concourse cluster]

Disclaimer: This repo is not a substitute for a properly designed tool, however could be utilized as a starting point.

== Requirements
* SSL cert and keys for Concourse Web Portal
* AWS Elastic Load Balancer configured for Concourse and SSL
* AWS Route53 CName for Concouse ELB
* Configured Bosh Cloud Config
* Concourse BOSH Release and Deployment Manifest

== Generate Concourse SSL Cert and Keys
. Update the link:./openssl.cnf[included openssl.cnf] file with your Route53 Domain names (eg. *.yourdomain.com, *.concourse.yourdomain.com)

. Generate Concourse TLS cert and keys
+
----
openssl genrsa -out concourse.pem 2048
openssl req -sha256 -new -key concourse.pem -out csr.pem -config openssl.cnf
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in csr.pem -signkey concourse.pem -out concourse-certificate.pem
openssl rsa -in concourse -outform PEM
aws iam upload-server-certificate --server-certificate-name concourse-server-certificate --certificate-body file://concourse-certificate.pem --private-key file://concourse.pem
aws iam get-server-certificate --server-certificate-name concourse-server-certificate
----

. Verify AWS upload of Cert 
+
----
$ aws iam get-server-certificate --server-certificate-name concourse-server-certificate

443  -> 4443
2222 -> 2222
----

. Attach your previously uploded *concourse-server-certificate* to the SSL port 443 of _concourse-elb_
. Create a Route53 entry for *concourse.yourdomain.com* and set CName to DNS of _concourse-elb_

== Update Bosh Cloud Config for Concourse
. Target your original PCF Bosh Director and output Bosh Cloud Config 
+
----
$ bosh target 10.0.10.1
RSA 1024 bit CA certificates are loaded due to old openssl compatibility
